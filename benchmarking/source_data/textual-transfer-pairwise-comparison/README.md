In each json line, the fields are as follows.

- `ori_style`: The style of the original sentence. This value will either be 0 or 1.
- `model1`: The model corresponding to `sent1`.
- `model2`: The model corresponding to `sent2`.
- `sent1`: The transferred sentence generated by the first model.
- `sent2`: The transferred sentence generated by the second model.
- `style_better`: 1 if the style of the first sentence is better than the style of the second sentence; 2 if the style of the second sentence is better than the style of the first sentence; -1 if there is a tie.
- `content_better`: Possible values are 1, 2, -1. Definitions are analogous to `style_better`. For example, a value of 1 means that the content preservation of the first sentence is better than the content preservation of the second sentence. 
- `lang_better`: Possible values are 1, 2, -1. Definitions are analogous to `style_better`. For example, a value of 1 means that the fluency of the first sentence is better than the fluency of the second sentence.
